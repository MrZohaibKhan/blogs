# Troubleshooting ADO Pipeline Environment Issues: A Case Study

In the world of DevOps, automation and continuous integration are key. However, sometimes even the most well-oiled machines can run into issues. Recently, I faced a curious problem with an Azure DevOps (ADO) pipeline during a production release. Here's a detailed account of the issue, the investigation, and the resolution.

## The Issue

A developer was deploying a new release and encountered the following error:


The error suggested that the specified environment, `TargetPay-Approvals`, could not be found or was not authorized. However, I knew this environment existed and had been used in previous deployments.

## The Investigation

Upon receiving the call from the developer, I joined a troubleshooting session. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we did:

1. **Checked the Pipeline YAML:**
   We inspected the pipeline YAML configuration. The environment name `TargetPay-Approvals` was correctly specified in the YAML file.

2. **Verified Environment in ADO:**
   Next, we navigated to the Environments section in ADO. The `TargetPay-Approvals` environment was indeed present.

3. **Identified a Mismatch:**
   Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the environment was pointing to a different configuration than expected. The name `TargetPay-Approvals` was familiar to me as an environment I had previously renamed.

4. **Renaming Insight:**
   It dawned on me that the environment might be pointing to its previous configuration before the rename. But why would this happen now?

## The Root Cause

After further investigation, I discovered the developer had created a new release, version 7.1, from the `develop` branch instead of the `release` branch, version 7.0. The `develop` branch had not been updated to reflect the environment changes made in the `release` branch.

## The Resolution

To resolve the issue, we took the following steps:

1. **Updated the Develop Branch:**
   I updated the `develop` branch with the latest environment configurations to ensure consistency across branches.

2. **Merged Changes:**
   We then merged these updates into the new `release` branch for version 7.1.

3. **Re-Ran the Pipeline:**
   After making these changes, we re-ran the pipeline, and the deployment proceeded without any issues.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Branch Consistency:**
   Ensure that all branches, especially `develop` and `release`, are consistent with critical configurations, such as environment settings.

2. **Environment Renaming:**
   Be cautious when renaming environments. Verify that all references in the codebase and pipeline configurations are updated accordingly.

3. **Communication:**
   Maintain clear communication with the development team about any changes to the infrastructure or environment configurations.

By following these steps, we were able to identify and resolve the issue quickly. This incident reinforced the importance of consistency and communication in maintaining a smooth CI/CD pipeline.

## Conclusion

In DevOps, challenges like these are opportunities to improve our processes. By understanding the root cause and implementing the necessary fixes, we ensure more robust and reliable deployments in the future. Always keep your branches updated and double-check configurations after any significant changes to avoid similar issues.
